# Usage





Usage information in general for downloads of De Dikke Blauwe can be obtained through publisher usage statistics. For example, if I look at https://www.aup-online.com/admin/reporting/usage/prepare.action?reportName=ftd_per_title_per_month for October to December, then I can see usage for the individual volumes of the magazine. Similarly you can see abstract views too.

We have also enabled Book reports for COUNTER 5. They are visible under Title reports and will show usage when authenticated institutional users access De Dikke Blauwe.

Regarding COUNTER reports, https://confluence.ingenta.com/confluence/display/AUP/User+Management+Tool#UserManagementTool-11.ViewandmanageCOUNTER5ReportsforOrganization provides information on how you can download COUNTER 5 Standard and Master reports for any institution when you are logged in as the site administrator.

https://confluence.ingenta.com/confluence/display/AUP/Institutional+Administrators+FAQs provides some information for institutional administrators to access their own COUNTER reports.

https://www.aup-online.com/help/sushi is a public-facing help page which describes COUNTER 5 SUSHI setup.

The implementation is as per the COUNTER 5 specifications provided at https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-zero-two/. We are currently reviewing version 5.1 which becomes effective from Jan 2025.

Regarding what counts as a download and an abstract view in publisher statistics- A click to get the full text whether PDF, HTML, EPUB or the e-reader view of an item counts as a download. Accessing the homepage of a content item counts as an abstract view for publisher statistics.

You can see abstract views for content through the following reports in the publisher statistics list.


For the magazine content, if users are authenticated as an institution when they access the full text then the usage will be recorded against their institutional account and will be visible in their COUNTER stats. For example, one of the magazine issues has usage from "Amsterdam University Press" (registration number 33264576 ) and HvA Hogeschool van Amsterdam (registration number cid-2865) have had downloads counted against their accounts - see the screenshots below from their TR_B1 COUNTER 5 reports.

 
The current subscribers report https://www.aup-online.com/admin/reporting/usage/prepare.action?reportName=current_subscribers available from the publisher statistics listing page should enable you to see a list of current subscribers per title.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have further questions.
