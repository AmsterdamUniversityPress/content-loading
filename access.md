# Access

## Access types
Access types determine the conditions under which users can access and use the content. Subscribed means users need to be logged-in. OA and Free means users need not be logged-in. 

### AUP business models
AUP business models have three types of access

1. Subscribed (customer pays)
2. Open Access (author/institution pays)
3. Free (AUP pays)

### AUP ONline
The platform supports four types of access

1. S = Titles Subscribed To
2. OA = Open Access Content = content will be shown to users as Open Access on the platform.
3. T = Free Trial Content = content will be shown to users as indefinitely Free on the platform.
4. F = Free Content

## XML
The access type is included in the XML - both JATS and BITS - through `<license>` and its `@license-type` attribute in  the `<permissions>` element.

### Subscribed to
Omit `<license>` from `<permissions>`.

Example from `10.5117.ANTW2023.1.007.LEEZ`:

```xml
<permissions>
<copyright-statement>&#x00a9; Michiel Leezenberg</copyright-statement>
<copyright-year>2023</copyright-year>
<copyright-holder>Michiel Leezenberg</copyright-holder>
</permissions>
```

### Free content
Use "free" or "FREE" as the value of the @license-type attribute.

Example from `10.5117.ANTW2023.1.001.DORR`:

```xml
<permissions>
<copyright-statement>&#x00a9; Steven Dorrestijn &#x0026; Herman Westerink</copyright-statement>
<copyright-year>2023</copyright-year>
<copyright-holder>Steven Dorrestijn &#x0026; Herman Westerink</copyright-holder>
<license license-type="free"><license-p></license-p></license>
</permissions>
```

### Open Access 
Use "open-access" or "OPEN-ACCESS" as the value of the @license-type attribute. Also, add a link to the appropriate _Creative Commons_ license using the @xlink:href attribute.

Example from `10.5117.QUE2022.1.001.KLEI`:

```xml
<permissions>
<copyright-statement>&#x00a9; Ru Klein</copyright-statement>
<copyright-year>2022</copyright-year>
<copyright-holder>Ru Klein</copyright-holder>
<license license-type="open">

```

This is displayed as follows on the platform:
```

### the other elements in `<permissions>`

1. `<copyright-statement>`
2. `<copyright-year>`
3. `<copyright-holder>`
