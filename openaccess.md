# Open Access

If a content item is Open Access - e.g., a book chapter or article - then it needs to have [the correct license](licenses.md) in the metadata (i.e. JATS or BITS XML).

It _also_ needs to have a Creative Commons License in the content, i.e. in the PDF, if it not fulltext XML. This is a job for the typesetter.

It sometimes happens that only _after_ printing the content items becomes Open Access. In that case, the print PDF cannot be used and a new PDF has to be generated. This is a job for the typesetter. _That_ PDF can then be uploaded to the platform.
