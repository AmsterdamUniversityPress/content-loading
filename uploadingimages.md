# Uploading images

How to upload images onto AUP ONline?

## the editor
On pages where the site admin can change or add text, there is a text editor. It has a button that allows you to add an image.

### getting the image in there

1. _Drop Image_. Drag an image from your computer and drop it onto the text editor
2. _Browse_. Select an image from a database of images. which is WHERE and how do you put images in it? (It seems that any uploaded images is added to it...)
3. _Upload Image_. Select an image from your computer and upload it. _This doesn't work ☹️_
4. _By URL_. Instead of inserting the image into the page, you are _referring_ to it. Think of it as a hyperlink to an image. It prevents copying files, but it does require the image to be online...

### making the image look right
