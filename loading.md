### Book file packaging structure
1. Content for a book must be sent in a single zip file to the specified SFTP location.
2. The content loading pipeline accepts either a zip file for a book with one XML file for the book and chapters with supporting PDFs, images etc. OR one XML file per chapter with the supporting PDFs, images etc. A combination of the two is not supported. 
3. All chapters supplied within a zip file must belong to the same book.
4. The name of the zip and files within the zip must be one word without spaces.
5. If the files within the zip are supplied within folders, the file names must be unique across the zip.
6. Names of all the files within a zip must be unique.
