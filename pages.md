### filters
Search pages have filters (example)[https://qa.aup-online.com/search?value1=pindakaas&option1=fulltext], but content pages can have filters too (example)[https://qa.aup-online.com/content/publications].

1. There is no way for the site admin to set filters on content pages
2. The site admin cannot create content pages of the type `/content/someinformationhere`.
3. There is no way for the site admin to set the A-Z functionality on content pages


## information pages
These are pages with a URL of the type `https://qa.aup-online.com/information`. (Example)[https://qa.aup-online.com/pindakaas]. 

The site admin can create these pages.

### creating an information page

1. Login as site admin
2. Go to `https://aup-online.com/`. Type `/` and the name of the page you want to create, e.g. `specialoffer`. Avoid spaces and non-ASCII characters. The page is now created.
3. To add content to the page, click on the little pencil symbol below the text `This page has not been defined`.
4. A popup now appears. This allows you to enter text and images.
5. An interesting option is "template". This allows you to choose a template for the layout of your new page. IT is also possible to create a page and set that as a template.
6. After creating the page there is an option to remove it again...

## function pages
Function pages are pages where the site admin can _do_ somethng: create an account, get a report, manage distribution, or change the site design.
