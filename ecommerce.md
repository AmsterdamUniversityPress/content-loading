## institution subscriptions
In addition to individual purchases for books, chapters, articles etc. Edify offers options for institution subscriptions.

## automated feeds
Publishers can supply subscription information in automated feeds in CSV format which are processed on a schedule to automatically create subscription access for those institutions in the site.

## offline purchasing capabilities
You could opt to enable offline purchasing capabilities within the site. Institutional administrators can add items to their cart and submit the cart for offline payment instead of purchasing it online through e-commerce. An email with the contents of the cart as an invoice will be sent to the institutional administrator as well as AUP sales staff. In the background, Edify creates a pending license against the selected content for the institution’s account. The institution won’t have access at this point because the payment hasn’t yet been made and the license is in pending state. After the payment has been made offline, AUP staff can activate the license through a single click in the user management tool.

## volume and issue purchases
Edify can also offer options for volume and issue purchases. We can also integrate with print and print on demand fulfilment providers for print purchases and provide Patron Driven Acquisition access to institutions.
