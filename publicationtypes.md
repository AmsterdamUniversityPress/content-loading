### Search pages and Content pages
- there are Search pages and Content pages
- Content pages can have filters and A-Z (so are not strictly separate from Search pages)
- Filtering on a content page does not alter the URL. Adding search parameter to a content page's URL (e.g. `https://qa.aup-online.com/content/books?value1=Book&option1=contentType`) does not alter the page

Note that there are other types of pages as well, e.g.

- root pages, like `/banaan`
- admin pages

### Search pages individual items

type | URL | remark
----- | ----- | -----
Conference Papers | `/search?value1=ConferencePaper&option1=contentType` | 
Magazine Issues | `/search?value1=MagazineIssue&option1=contentType` | 
Articles | `//search?value1=Article&option1=contentType` | Note the `//` <!-- This is NOT `/search?value1=article&option1=contentType` -->
Fast Track Articles | `/search?value1=FastTrackArticle&option1=contentType` | 
Chapters | `/search?value1=Chapter&option1=contentType` | 

The overall search for these items is:

- `//search?value1=Article+OR+Chapter+OR+MagazineIssue+OR+ConferencePaper+OR+FastTrackArticle&option1=contentType`

(In spite of the `//` above, it seems the overall search also works with a single `/`.
