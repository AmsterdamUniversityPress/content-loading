# Imprints

This is about managing imprints on AUP Online. On the platform, the term **publishers** is used.

## how to add a new publisher?
This is on QA:

1. log-in as site admin
2. go to `https://qa.aup-online.com/content/publishers`
3. click on the edit menu on the left-hand side (wrench symbol) and select `Create new Publisher`
4. Fill in the desired fields in the pop-up menu and click on `Create` in the bottom right corner.

## how to add a publisher to a publication?


It is _not_ possible to "change" a product's publisher after it has been published on AUP Online. This means you have to assign it a publisher at publication time. The only way around this is to ask Ingenta to do it manually. Do this in emergencies only.

1. create a publishers
2. create publications "under" the publisher, manually onsite or via the XML




Why is there no "publisher" option when manually editing a publication's metadata on the platform?

1. XML.... test this...

2. ask Ingenta to do this manually. (Why can't AUP do this  themselves??)
